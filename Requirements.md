Vision:

A webpage that allows users to either share a book or get a book to read. However, they have to share a book in order to be able to receive a book. The idea of this website came to be because there is a significant amount of people who buy books and they donâ€™t read them. By having this website people can save money, storage space, and maybe the environment by not having to buy a new copy of the book.

Scope (in/out)

in: 
    - The user has to share one book in order to get a book
    - Search bar by title or author
    - Pages:
        - About us
        - Broswer library
        - Share a Book
    - Add an animation 
    
Out:
    - Not going to make the animation bounce for each book they enter. If they enter 1 book it will bounce once and if they enter 5 books it will still only bounce once
    - Not going to add social media icons

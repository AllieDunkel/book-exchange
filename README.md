Description: A webpage that allows users to either share a book or get a book to read. However, they have to share a book in order to be able to receive a book. The idea of this website came to be because there is a significant amount of people who buy books and they donâ€™t read them. By having this website people can save money,  storage space, and maybe the environment by not having to buy a new copy of the book.

          Teresa <br>
          I recently returned to the area after living the past seven years in the San Fransico bay area. I retired from Procter & Gamble after 22 years of service. My most recent role with P&G was that of Anaylst I (Technical and Admisistrative), supporting a NorCal regional sales team. Our team broke all sales records for four consecutive years. I'm currently pursuing a Software Development certification through Delta V. My hobbies include walking, biking, and gardening.
